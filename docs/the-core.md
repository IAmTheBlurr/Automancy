# Core Modules
The core modules are a bit weird.  Some are base classes for some of the more complex objects within Automancy.  Others are stand-alone in their functionality.

Only a handful of modules from `core/` are described briefly here, and only at a high level.  These modules will be described in greater detail in their own reference documentation
